## **Picture a Scientist** is both a global movement and a powerful film documenting the stories of scientists who have experienced harassment, bigotry, misogyny, racism, and bias in their career and their workplace. 
<br>

### *As a movement, Picture a Scientist has provided a platform for scientists around the world to submit their own anonymous stories and experiences related to diversity or as a minority in science.* 
<br>
